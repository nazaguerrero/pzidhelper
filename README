# Project Zomboid B42.13.1 Mod Grabber

A simple, single-file browser tool to help server admins quickly build the `WorkshopItems` and `Mods` lines for Project Zomboid multiplayer servers (Build 42.13.1 and later).

Just paste Workshop IDs, full Steam URLs, or mod names — the tool tries to auto-detect the correct Mod ID (with fallback/manual entry when Steam API blocks CORS).

**Features**
- Auto-adds leading `\` to Mod IDs (required for B42.13+ servers)
- Handles Workshop numeric ID, full Steam URL, or mod name search
- Manual entry mode for when browser CORS blocks Steam API
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- One-click copy of ready-to-paste server.ini lines

## How to Use

1. Download `pz-mod-grabber.html`
2. Open it in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge…)
3. Paste mod info and click "Add Mod"
4. When done → click "Copy both lines to clipboard"
5. Paste directly into your `servertest.ini` or custom server config
